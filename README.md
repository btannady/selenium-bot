# selenium-bot

Developed in Python using open-source Selenium WebDriver, this automation testing project was crafted with the aim of evaluating website performance and maintaining quality assurance.
<br />
<br />
The project focuses on integrating fundamental principles of software testing, streamlining error checking procedures by following Page Object Model (POM) and the Unit Testing framework. After all tests have been run, an automated documentation of quality assurance reports are generated into HTML visualizations for straightforward and comprehensive analysis. 
<br />
<br />
Made with Python, Selenium, HtmlTestRunner.
